This site documents my experiences applying [Toyota's lean principles][5] and [Dr Deming's System of Profound Knowledge][6] to transform QA teams from inspection-based testing to prevention-focused methodologies. As a dev lead and systems architect who moved into QA leadership, I led the transformation of 4 QA teams over 4 years.

Learn how QA teams can evolve their practices through four interconnected learning paths:

1. [Main Site][8]: Transformation stories with code examples, visual documentation, and implementation resources
2. [Deming Driven Testing (DDT)][1]: Step-by-step cultural and technical transformation methodology for QA teams moving from defect inspection to prevention
3. [Sheep Dog Blog][2]: Curated podcast episodes with practical insights and notes supporting the DDT transformation approach
4. [Specification By Prompt (SBP)][3]: Modern approach to breaking up monoliths using QA's natural language specifications with AI-assisted development tools

This is a work in progress so I'll be updating it daily/weekly. In general the documentation is divided up as so:
1. [Main Site Stories][8]: Team transformation stories with code references and pictures
2. [Visual Documentation][4]: Visual Prezi documentation to be updated with DDT content
3. [GitHub Repo README][9]: Instructions for building and running the code
4. [GitHub Repo Wiki][10]: Design explanations, roadmap, and developer notes for Xtext/Maven
5. [GitHub Repo sheep-dog-qa][11]: Plugin usage notes as living documentation and test cases
