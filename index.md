The goal of this site and supporting code is to describe my experiences applying Toyota's lean principles and Dr Deming's System of Profound Knowledge to the QA teams I led for 4 years. 
I'm not a traditional QA professional; I've built, architected and deployed enterprise systems but realised the need to cease dependency on inspection alone meant QA teams had to change significantly.
Unfortunately there wasn't much information online about how QA teams support developers in ceasing this dependency and so when the opportunity came along to lead the 4 teams, I took it.

# Sites

The about section of each of the 4 sites goes into more detail but here's the summary.

1. **farhan5248**: It's just this page and the about, a list of books and Git repos. It's to give an overview of the work and my background.

2. [**Deming Driven Testing (DDT)**:](demingdriventesting) Covers what the problem was, how I solved it while on the QA team and how I'd do it again.

3. [**Sheep Dog Blog**:](sheepdogblog) I've selected certain episodes from podcasts I listen to with notes about what is relevant to doing the QA transformation.

4. [**Specification By Prompt (SBP)**:](specificationbyprompt) This describes how I would go about breaking up a monolith by using the QA team's natural language DSL. 
Each feature file would be treated as a prompt for Claude code to write the code from scratch. I need to clean-up the code first and document design choices etc, with help from Claude of course :).

# Documentation

This is a work in progress so I'll be updating it daily/weekly. In general the documentation is divided up as so:
1. **farhan5248.github.io**: The stories of how the team transformed are here. I'm working to include references to example code in the Git repos and more pictures.
2. **Prezi**: My first attempt at documentation was this [Prezi](https://prezi.com/view/yNpSiGMbioX8lNp5tS2q/). Unfortunately it's not searchable and was getting too big. I prefer Prezi as it's more visual so I'll update it to reflect the content in the Deming Driven Testing site. 
3. **GitHub Repo README**: How to build and run the code.
4. **GitHub Repo Wiki**: Explanations about why I designed things the way I did, roadmap of stuff that's left to implement and notes on how to create/modify the code for first time Xtext or Maven plug-in developers.
5. **GitHub Repo sheep-dog-qa**: This has the usage notes on how the plug-ins work. It's both the test cases and user manual. I wanted it to be an example of living documentation.
