# My background

I've been a Java developer for 15 years primarily working on the architecture, design and deployments or large enterprise systems. 
Over the past 10 years, I've led a development team (~20 people) and a QA team (~40 people). 
I spent most of my time on architecture, design and automated deployments.I've worked on really large integration projects (20 environments with a single environment having 20, 50 or 200 VM). 
I've gone from doubting to loving TDD/BDD and supporting other developers and testers in adopting it. 

# Why I've made this and is it for you?

During that time I found that QA took weeks to months to complete their test execution phase and in most cases didn't think CICD or DevOps applied to them.
When I went looking for information, I never read about how anyone got their traditional QA teams to change.
There's information on how to use Cucumber to automate your tests but not how you get a large QA team to do so with legacy technology like COBOL or unpopular stuff like PL/SQL or how to have the tests run earlier without adding more resources or delays.
Eventually when the opportunity presented itself, I decided to lead a large QA team to figure out how to help them evolve. 
That one QA team initially had 4 QA teams of almost 50-60 individuals.

Though I first started with automating deployments, in hindsight we should have started with changing the way we did QA.
I'd say it's for similar reasons as described in [this episode of Small Batches](https://smallbatches.fm/107). 
Just as TDD is skill zero, helping the QA teams evolve should be one of the first priorities.
So if you've read some of the books that I've read or listened to these podcasts and you're interested in reading about examples of how they were applied when leading a QA team down this path then perhaps this helps you.

# Why Sheep Dog? 

Originally the approach I took was inspired by the Improvement Kata which is described in Mike Rother's book, Toyota Kata.
Later when I heard [Ryan Tierney (Lean Made Simple podcast)](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxesmBzvq8mTLdD9ATv4epw1bAVDz6Ln6x?si=LrO6ScEXzI4-VbAV) use the sheep dog analogy, it resonated with me since I'm a dog person. 
Basically if you send in a bulldog to do the job, it runs into the middle of the flock barking and disrupting everything. 
With a sheep dog, you never see it; you see the grass around the sheep move, you see the sheep move and everything happens quietly and peacefully. 
When I thought about how to transform my team, I realised heroic effort was unsustainable and big bang changes were bound to be too much effort. 
Instead it had to be this gradual organic evolution of our ways of working similar to a sheep dog moving a flock. 

# How I'm trying to share the knowledge

While helping the team learn, I found that instead of giving cold hard facts and principles, I communicated better with stories.
In this site, I'm attempting to explain some principles that I applied to those teams by recounting some of my experiences.
I'm putting as much of my knowledge that I've accumulated so far using models for coding/testing in these repos as examples that I'll reference in the stories.
Hopefully this makes it easier for someone else who's interested in doing similar things.

I'm actually listening to The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt for inspiration. 
I'm starting with the QA portion of my story but there's also the dev portion.
That is, what made me think of joining a QA team when my own team did TDD/BDD and had a CICD pipeline and fully automated deployments to production; why wasn't that enough?
